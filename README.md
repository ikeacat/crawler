# Crawler

a wip game about crime n' stuff

runs in the browser (so it is easily accessable)

(this branch is an archive, when I eventually update it. Being behind master is the point.)

### TODO:

(Most important -> Least Importance)
- Fix Downloads reading from Local Storage
- Allow loading save from Local Storage
- Mission 1 as a whole.
- Add Deletion system.
- Dark mode (add as go along)
